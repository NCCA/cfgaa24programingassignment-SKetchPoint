#Savannah Kreider s5501023 CFGAA Assignment
- Assignment Ideas/Work Doc
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Design of classes/structures:
- 
- Main game class: initialize game playable area, handeling input, updategame state, render, game flow

- Scene class: playabl areas and wall generated, collisions to walls handled from cone and scoops
- Block class:collectable blocks falling , properties include position, type either scoop or trash, initial speeds on anxisi, points
- Cone class :players movable cone, properties include positon, lives, points, movement input, collision detect from falling block, update score and lives
- Game Menu class: manages game start, pause, and end, input for starting pausing and restarting the game
- End Screen class: allows player to pick to either exit window(closing it) or to play again on a new game
- 
- Streach Goals(if time allowed):
-
- Highscore class: saves the high score between game sessions
- Pause Menu class: pausing and resuming game with e to pause the game and r to resume 
- Effect class:  manges visual effect of sparks for a sucessful landing 
- 
- 
- Directory Structure:
- 
- src:MainGame,Scene,Block,Cone,GameMenu,EndScreen.cpp
- include:MainGame,Scene,Block,Cone,GameMenu,EndScreen.h
- CMakeList.txt
- .github (and .gitignore)
- README.md
- 
- 
- 
- NOTE: look at photos to try to get blankNGL up from prior week and grab mouse movement from 25 April labcode to rotate scene around
-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Idea 4 plan revised
-
-Requirements Notes-3D Game, obj subject to gravity, least 2 objs, may wany user control parameters, two or more rigid objs in cubical container
-Setting up gameplay box to contain the 'cone' controlled by the user through wsad or follows mouse
-'cone' allows for 'scoops' and 'trash' to be caught by user,but can also not be caught if it hits the floor
-'scoops' increase score(displayed) and height, 'trash' decreases life(displayed),
-faster bonus 'scoops' allow for powerups (life increase, speed falling decrease, shielf from trash)
-allowing to adjust perspective through mouse click and drag, wsad to move, issue is as it builds height
-streach goals on plan revised
-maybe have an effect to lower height to keep things seen or "water" rising after each round complete
-increase effect sparks for landing 'scoops' on 'cone'ok, good, and perfect, sparks bounce on objs easier than 'trash' or 'scoops'
- pause and resume game
- able to start a new game w/o open and close 
- save user data?
-jump cone with space bar
-friction adjust gameplay box with E and R
-color changes of 'scoops'
-user pick 'scoops' and 'trash' mesh via buy w 'coins' collected after play
- customs bought through 'coins' collected after the game is done calc based on time, score, and ammount of bonuses
-user pick theme of the gameplay (color scoops, trash, cone, play box, bg and text)

  -Ideation:
- Idea#1- Scrapped
- Creating a sandbox 3D game that simulates simple water, fire like particles, and changes in 3D block "pixels" with sand being heated to change to glass, water on dirt to make mud, lightning on metal to make a little current. Heavuly Inspired by the game "The Sandbox" that was initially made in 2D with less elements to play with
- and/or
- "Destroy it" sandbox game where you have weapons to destroy the level creatively. The more you destroy, the better you score in a certain time. Inspired by "Teardown" game. Having things like flamethrowers and explosions to have blocks explode into smaller particles with applied effect(fire rises up in a controlled wave, explosion Sperkler effect, etc..)
- Design of Game:
- User Control: Via wsad keyboard to move around, right mouse moves camera, left to aim, e to attack
- weapons: damage animation or particle to hit destructible areas, if hits takes damage that the weapon can cause, type of damage it causes (color changes?), size of damage that it affects the surface(radius)
- different materials: material strength/health, if it shows/life, material type for max health, color that can change if burned, location
- grouping prebuilt structures to spawn? grouping of area damaged, if high enough, could also do separate chunks and indv blocks
-(sandbox mode? to create structures?)
- build of block + ray tracing (lights, shadows) for the display of the game
- count down display
- score display (each damage count to blocks/ # of attacks)
- restart game
  
- Idea#2:scrapped
-  Most extreme way to kill a cockroach (big flipflop, fire, hammer, similar to destroy it sim)
-  prebuilt structure made up of blocks with different materials that can be smashed, squashed, burned, destroyed,ect
-  -cockroach (smaller than building blocks) scampers about the room as you try to smash it and your surroundings
-  win immediately by eliminating all of cockroach health
-  score similar to Idea 1
  
- Idea#3:backup
- 3D game stacking game
- catch falling plushies based on the game "Scoops"
- a few diffrent items will be valid to catch with your plate, making it climb higher and higher
- negative items (trash/ horror version of plushies) taking away a life and/or power downs 
- going in an enviroment to where you use your mouse to drag around your plate (avoiding a complete top-down view)
- pause/ play
- score based on items catched, gained exponentially more as you go up in height
- cam follow as you go up to more 2D perspective as speed of drop increases
- lose 1 point for each valid item missed, 2 points gained for a catch starting
- Idea #4-
  
- Dice rolling sim with effects
- digital dice roll for DND campaignes
- 8 dice to pick (standard set+D2)
- user can customize the dice and pick dice through slider ui for base color, lettering, and additional appearances as well as picking their dice through it
- once landing can pick effect( water ripple, fire, smoke, sparking) as it hits around the virtual dice tray and landing
- effect for hitting a nat 1 or nat 20
- recording the last few rolls in a side panel of "log book" page
